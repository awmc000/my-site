	<h2>About me</h2>
	<img src="me1.jpg" width="100px">
	<img src="me2.jpg" width="100px">
	<p>My name is Alex and I live on Vancouver Island
	with the love of my life Mika. Pronouns: he/him.
	I love computing, language, and history.
	You can find me on 
	<a href="https://github.com/awmc000">Github</a> and
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awmc2000/">LinkedIn</a> as well.</p>

	<h3>School</h3>

	<p>
		I am working on my Bachelor's of Science
		in Computer Science at Vancouver Island University
		in Nanaimo. I'm about halfway through
		my degree, and have taken classes in Java and C++ 
		programming, software engineering, computer architecture,
		calculus and discrete math, among others.
	</p>

	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Obtain a co-op.</b> I am looking for work that will help me 
		launch and grow my career. I apply to both software development
		and testing roles.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Work on my personal projects.</b> My CHIP8 emulator (an interpreter, really)
		is nearing completion. After that I might try another emulation project, or to
		write a game for the CHIP8 or other retro system.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Make open source contributions.</b> I finished my PR adding Bezier
		curve functionality to the PDF drawing library FPDF2 a while ago. I hope to make more open
		source contributions in the near future.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Continue intensive study of Chinese language.</b> I've finished my first pass
		of 小王子 (The Little Prince) and am reviewing it as I learn the last few words
		I didn't commit to memory yet. Afterward I hope to pick another novel to learn
		vocabulary for and read.
