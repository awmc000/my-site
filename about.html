	<h2>About me</h2>

	<img src="me2.jpg" width="100px">
	<p>My name is Alex and I live on Vancouver Island
	with the love of my life Mika. Pronouns: he/him.
	I love computing, language, and history.
	You can find me on 
	<a href="https://github.com/awmc000">Github</a> and
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awmc2000/">LinkedIn</a> as well.</p>

	<h3>School</h3>

	<p>
		I am working on my Bachelor's of Science
		in Computer Science at Vancouver Island University
		in Nanaimo. I'm about halfway through
		my degree, and have taken classes in Java and C++ 
		programming, software engineering, computer architecture,
		calculus and discrete math, among others.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm currently enrolled in a course called Systems
		and Networks, which involves learning to configure and
		maintain Linux environments for different scenarios,
		and other, more general CS topics, like how hard drives,
		memory, and computer networks work. I've come to really 
		like Linux so it's been great. The other CS 
		course I'm taking right now is Database Systems. So far,
		we have worked through ER modelling and queries in
		SQL, Datalog and relational algebra (esp. expression
		trees). Again this one is super fun, I really wanted to
		learn about databases.
	</p>

	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Obtain a co-op.</b> I am looking for work that will help me 
		launch and grow my career. I apply to both software development
		and tech support roles.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Work on my personal projects.</b> My geography game for the Nintendo
		DS is coming along nicely. Game logic is getting gradually smoother, and
		after that is where I want it, the goal is to add graphic elements. I still
		have updates in mind for my readability calculator, too.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Make open source contributions.</b> I recently finished my PR adding Bezier
		curve functionality to the PDF drawing library FPDF2. I hope to make more open
		source contributions over the summer.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Continue intensive study of Chinese language.</b> I am reading my first book
		not intended for learners, 小王子, The Little Prince. I will have to learn hundreds
		of new words but I am about a third of the way through the book already and it is a
		blast.
