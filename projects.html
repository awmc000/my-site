	<h3>Projects</h3>
	<i>Ordered here from most recent to oldest.</i>

	<h3>CHIP8 Emulator (Interpreter)</h3>
	<p>
		See article, more info and a gif coming soon.
	</p>

	<h3>Leetcode Badge Generator
	</h3>
	<p>
		I love old-web style 88x31 buttons, and built a simple web app
		to take a Leetcode username and generate a badge with their number
		of easy, medium, and hard problems solved. The backend is written
		in Python with FastAPI, making use of a SQLite database and queries 
		to Leetcode's GraphQL database. The front end is simple HTML and JS,
		and is my first time using Javascript. Currently working on extending
		this to generate different graphics.
	</p>

	<h3>Pomodoro Tkinter App
	</h3>
	<p>
		I built a study/work timer app real quick with the Python tkinter
		module. I find the pomodoro timer really helpful when I am trying to
		study or work and also found it silly I was using a web app for it all
		this time. The app is built in an object-oriented way.
	</p>

	<h3>This Site
	</h3>
	<p>
		This website is built in HTML and CSS and run on my own
		server, a Raspberry Pi, using Nginx. It renews its SSL 
		certificate with the Certbot snap. I've already learned a
		lot, troubleshooting some self-hosting problems: how to use
		Nginx, installing a newer version of RPi OS on my Raspberry Pi,
		port forwarding with my router, and hopefully many more...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The site still has a long way to go. I plan to have a more 
		interesting design soon.
	</p>

	<h3>World Path</h3>
	
	<img src="Worldpath.gif" width="400" height="600">
	
	<p>
	A game for the Nintendo DS that has the player make paths between 
	countries on the world map. Uses graph theory and breadth first search. 
	A reimplementation of Travle by Oisin Carroll. 
	Test-driven development from scratch in C and making use of the Check
	 library for unit testing, and NightFoxLib which builds on LibNDS for 
	Nintendo DS homebrew applications. Done, with dots on the
	world map as visual aid. Released the second development build May 2024.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Readability Calculator</h3>
	
	<img src="readability.png" width="600">
	
	<p>
	A tool which estimates the level of education required to read English writing without difficulty,
	based on the Dale-Chall formula developed in the 1940s for public communications and marketing.
	First development build released on Github for Linux.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Roguelike Level Generator</h3>
	
	<p>
	Used a binary partitioning algorithm, implemented in C#, 
	to generate varied and interesting dungeon levels for a 
	2D role playing game concept in the Unity Engine.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Other</h3>
	
	<p>
	I added Bezier curve drawing functionality to FPDF2, an open source
	Python library for drawing and rendering PDF documents. The new function
	can draw a cubic or quadratic Bezier curve with specified control points,
	end points, and line style. <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/fpdf2/pull/1174"> See my pull request here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	I contributed a couple simple functions to a 
	<a href="https://www.github.com/proh24/ptext">
		"nano-like text editor built with pure C"</a>.
	The functions were wrappers with error handling for malloc() and realloc().
	<a href="https://www.github.com/proh24/ptext/pull/19"> See my pull request here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I've experimented with the Nitro Engine for 3D game
	development on the nintendo DS. I got as far as
	a functional 3d demo where the player is a bird,
	with flapping wings, able to fly about the demo level.
