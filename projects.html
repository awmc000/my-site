	<h3>This Site
	</h3>
	<p>
		This website is built in HTML and CSS and run on my own
		server, a Raspberry Pi, using Nginx. It renews its SSL 
		certificate with the Certbot snap. I've already learned a
		lot, troubleshooting some self-hosting problems: how to use
		Nginx, installing a newer version of RPi OS on my Raspberry Pi,
		port forwarding with my router, and hopefully many more...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The site still has a long way to go. I plan to have a more 
		eccentric and interesting design soon.
	</p>

	<h3>World Path</h3>
	
	<img src="Worldpath.gif" width="400" height="600">
	
	<p>
	A game for the Nintendo DS that has the player make paths between 
	countries on the world map. Uses graph theory and breadth first search. 
	A reimplementation of Travle by Oisin Carroll. (Incomplete - graph and 
	world map implemented on Nintendo DS, no graphic map yet.)
	Test-driven development from scratch in C and making use of the Check
	 library for unit testing, and NightFoxLib which builds on LibNDS for 
	Nintendo DS homebrew applications.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Readability Calculator</h3>
	
	<img src="readability.png" width="600">
	
	<p>
	A tool which estimates the level of education required to read English writing without difficulty,
	based on the Dale-Chall formula developed in the 1940s for public communications and marketing.
	First development build released on Github for Linux.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Roguelike Level Generator</h3>
	
	<p>
	Used a binary partitioning algorithm, implemented in C#, 
	to generate varied and interesting dungeon levels for a 
	2D role playing game concept in the Unity Engine.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Other</h3>
	
	<p>
	I contributed a couple simple functions to a 
	<a href="https://www.github.com/proh24/ptext">
		"nano-like text editor built with pure C"</a>.
	The functions were wrappers with error handling for malloc() and realloc().
	See my pull request here <a href="https://www.github.com/proh24/ptext/pull/19">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I've experimented with the Nitro Engine for 3D game
	development on the nintendo DS. I got as far as
	a functional 3d demo where the player is a bird,
	with flapping wings, able to fly about the demo level.
