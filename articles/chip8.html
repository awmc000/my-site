    <h2>Notes on writing my CHIP8 interpreter</h2>
    <p>Over the summer I've been building a CHIP8 interpreter.
        This is the recommended entry point to emulator development,
        and it doesn't take awfully long. I'm 26 hours in on mine and
        more experienced programmers have done it faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a very fun project especially if you are fascinated with
        retro computing and assembly language. I think the mistakes I
        made are the most interesting part. Over the course of the project
        I made many little logic errors and also some sketchy design choices,
        of which I've fixed all of the former type that I know about, and am
        working on the second.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Confusing different variables.</b>
        The Chip8 programming language resembles a processor instruction
        set but is simpler. Often an instruction includes a byte operand X.
        In some instructions this byte is the operand and in others, the 
        operand is in <i>register</i> X. It was very easy to trip up
        and apply an operation to X when it should have been VX.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found these and fixed them quickly for the most part. The one
        I was stuck on the longest had to do with setting the frontend modifying
        the keypad up/down flags. In the functions implementing instructions
        which check if a key is up or down, I was checking for key X instead of 
        <i>the key stored in VX</i>, and not only that, I was checking the registers
        instead of the keypad flags. I just fixed this last week with fresh eyes
        after having taken a break from this project and this was all that stood 
        between me and the games being playable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, I think the experience of troubleshooting these bugs, and giving
        a close read to how the instructions are supposed to behave, will help me
        make these kinds of mistakes less often in the future and fix them faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Wasteful way of simulating clock speed.</b>
        The interpreter itself has a function "cycle()" that the frontend calls.
        My frontend uses a high precision C++ timer to count up to 1429 microseconds,
        because this gets the desired clock speed,
        run a cycle, and redraw the display if the draw flag is set, etc. This could
        and will be done better. I plan to rewrite the logic a bit so that cycles are executed
        as fast as possible up to when the draw flag is set next.
