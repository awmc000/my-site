    <h2>I totally loved my computer networking class.</h2>
    <p>
        This spring semester I took a 4th year course in Computer Networking. For the
        lab component we were given headers and unit tests and from that implemented
        an FTP client in stages, and then an FTP server. For the lecture component we
        worked our way up the OSI model from physical considerations like single mode
        vs. multi mode fibre, to flow control algorithms like Go Back N, all the way up
        to reviewing how a recursive resolver works in DNS.
    </p>
    <h2>Going deeper with a personal project</h2>
    <p>
        Building basic stuff from scratch seems to be a great learning exercise in
        programming. Building your own RDBMS, build your own HTTP server, etc. There's 
        a platform taking advantage of that now called CodeCrafters, but I'm not 
        going to use that. It seems even better if I write my own tests and whatnot.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I found out about TFTP I was interested right away because of the "T". It's
        a file transfer protocol, but a lot simpler than FTP, and actually used in real life,
        OK, cool! And it came with a spec in the form of an RFC, so I didn't have to design
        the logic. I'd also get good practice implementing other people's ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided to use Python instead of the C++ (really just C with stdio) that we were
        writing in networking class. The reason for this is that it's syntactically easy and
        allows me to abstract away from a lot of headaches like FD_SET, populating structs, etc.
        I also have a notion that the bottleneck is probably network IO. Still, it would be cool to
        rewrite this all in C once it's working.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been the tests first. So far, am only using Python standard library modules, and am trying
        to keep things simple. I'll outline a few areas where I'm fighting complexity.
    </p>
    <h2>Complexity and bugs so far</h2>
    <p>
        In order to write the best tests I've accepted two complexities. The first is that I do NOT want
        the client tests to require the server and vice versa; I do not want the tests to be coupled. That
        means manually and redundantly faking out all the server logic, using UDP sockets, in each test case.
        I have also brought in threads even though I am a bit of a noob with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Probably the most interesting bug I created so far was in the server tests. At the start of a given
        server test, I start a separate thread where the server waits for and serves requests. Then I create
        a client socket that manually carries out client behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
        A more experienced developer could probably see where the issue arises just in that sentence. A race
        condition led to a flaky test. Sometimes the client would send a request to the server, and sometimes
        the server was not yet able to bind, and the client would actually get back an ICMP Port Unreachable
        message. I only found out about that ICMP message by using Wireshark to snoop on my loopback adapter
        when this flaky test ran. That was the first time I used Wireshark to solve a problem, too, which was
        sick.
    </p>
    <p>
        This taught me that even though UDP is connectionless, there actually <i>is</i> an error returned if
        you fire a datagram and the port at the other end doesn't have an application bound to it to receive
        the datagram. And more importantly, the race condition seems so obvious in hindsight, where the client
        and server are racing to bind... so I won't make that particular mistake again.
    </p>
    <h2>Gonna try and finish this thing!</h2>
    <p>
        I've been working in fits and starts on this over the last month and a half - I probably wrote 25% the 
        week before finals and another 50% since then. The end is in sight. I hope to fully complete this thing,
        since it has a small scope too, within the next 2 weeks.
