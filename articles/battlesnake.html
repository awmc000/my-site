		The VIU CSCI Club, for which I am a director, hosted its second annual Battlesnake hackathon just a few days ago, as I write this.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The turnout was smaller than the previous year, but on the bright side, the crowd was much more focused. Danny from ITAS won the final tournament and helped many of us write our snake code.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I spent some time chasing my tail, trying to use Golang, but I found it didn’t play nice with the repl.it cloud repositories we were using, which we had to use because the campus firewall prevented us from self-hosting.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We all ended up using Python, which is a good match for the task since the speed requirement isn't too high. Each contestant's snake is a server that must respond to an HTTP request each turn. So, as long as your Python server can respond in 50ms, which they could, that’s fast enough.
