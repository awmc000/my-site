<h2>About me</h2>
My name is Alex and I live on Vancouver Island
with the love of my life Mika. Pronouns: he/him.
I love computing, language, and history.
You can find me on 
<a href="https://github.com/awmc000">Github</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awmc2000/">LinkedIn</a> as well.

<h3>School</h3>

<p>
	I am working on my Bachelor's of Science
	in Computer Science at Vancouver Island University
	in Nanaimo. I'm about halfway through
	my degree, and have taken classes in Java and C++ 
	programming, software engineering, computer architecture,
	calculus and discrete math, among others.
</p>

<p>
	I'm currently enrolled in a course called Systems
	and Networks, which involves learning to configure and
	maintain Linux environments for different scenarios,
	and other, more general CS topics, like how hard drives,
	memory, and computer networks work. I've come to really 
	like Linux so it's been great. The other CS 
	course I'm taking right now is Database Systems. So far,
	we have worked through ER modelling and queries in
	SQL, Datalog and relational algebra (esp. expression
	trees). Again this one is super fun, I really wanted to
	learn about databases.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
	<b>Obtain a co-op.</b> I am looking for work that will help me 
	launch and grow my career. I apply to both software development
	and tech support roles.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Work on my personal projects.</b> My geography game for the Nintendo
	DS is coming along nicely. Game logic is getting gradually smoother, and
	after that is where I want it, the goal is to add graphic elements. I still
	have updates in mind for my readability calculator, too.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Make open source contributions.</b> In particular, this spring I plan
	to add Bezier curves to the path drawing functionality of fpdf2.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Write for the history newsletter every couple months.</b> I wrote an article
	in February about Confucianism and memory as both technology and virtue. I love
	topics in social history like that and plan to write more. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>读书提高我的中文等级。</b>我真爱这个语言，希望一天流利地说。
