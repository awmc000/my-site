<h1>About me</h1>
My name is Alex and I live on Vancouver Island
with my beloved spouse Mika. Pronouns: he/him.
I love computing, language, and history. See my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>. 
You can find me on 
<a href="https://github.com/awmc000">Github</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awmc2000/">LinkedIn</a> as well.

<h2>School</h2>

<p>
I am working on my Bachelor's of Science
in Computer Science at Vancouver Island University
in Nanaimo. I'm about halfway through
my degree, and have taken classes in Java and C++ 
programming, software engineering, computer architecture,
calculus and discrete math, among others.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently enrolled in a course called Systems
and Networks, which involves learning to configure and
maintain Linux environments for different scenarios,
and other, more general CS topics, like how hard drives,
memory, and computer networks work. The other CS 
course I'm taking right now is Database Systems. So far,
we have worked through ER modelling and queries in
SQL, Datalog and relational algebra (esp. expression
trees).
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<i>Ordered here from most recent to oldest. Pictures coming soon.</i>
<h3>World Path</h3>

<p>
A game for the Nintendo DS that has the player make paths between 
countries on the world map. Uses graph theory and breadth first search. 
A reimplementation of Travle by Oisin Carroll. (Early stages - graph and 
world map implemented, no DS game yet.)
Test-driven development from scratch in C and making use of the Check
 library for unit testing.
</p>

<h3>Readability Calculator</h3>

<p>
A tool which estimates the level of education required to read English writing without difficulty,
based on the Dale-Chall formula developed in the 1940s for public communications and marketing.
First development build released on Github for Linux.
</p>

<h3>Roguelike Level Generator</h3>

<p>
Used a binary partitioning algorithm, implemented in C#, 
to generate varied and interesting dungeon levels for a 
2D role playing game concept in the Unity Engine.
</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>
I contributed a couple simple functions to a 
<a href="https://www.github.com/proh14/ptext">
	"nano-like text editor built with pure C"</a>.
The functions were wrappers with error handling for malloc() and realloc().
See my pull request here <a href="https://www.github.com/proh14/ptext/pull/19">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've experimented with the Nitro Engine for 3D game
development on the nintendo DS. I got as far as
a functional 3d demo where the player is a bird,
with flapping wings, able to fly about the demo level.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Land a co-op in the world of software development.</li>
	<li>Work on my personal projects some more.</li>
	<li>Make some more, and bigger, open source contributions.</li>
	<li>Keep doing Leetcode problems regularly, and more often.</li>
	<li>Try new languages and technologies. Rust and Typescript come to mind...</li>
	<li>Write for the history newsletter every couple months.</li>
	<li>继续读书，提高我的中文等级。</li>
	<li>努力锻炼！</li>
</ul>
